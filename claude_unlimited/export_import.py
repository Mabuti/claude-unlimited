"""Export/Import bundles.

`cryptography` is the single exception to the dependency-free-backend rule,
and its use is confined to this file. A bundle containing Profiles (and
therefore credentials) is ALWAYS passphrase-encrypted; Settings- or
Activity-only bundles are plain JSON, since they hold no secrets.

Two-step by design: import_bundle() only parses and never writes, so the
caller can preview the result and then call apply_import() explicitly. A bad
passphrase or a stale file therefore cannot silently mutate local state.
