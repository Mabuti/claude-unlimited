"""What shape an endpoint speaks, and how to translate to and from it.

Claude Code always speaks Anthropic Messages. What sits on the other side does
not: OpenAI's Codex backend speaks the Responses API, while LM Studio, Ollama
and most self-hosted servers speak OpenAI Chat Completions. Those differ in
both request and response shape, so pointing a Profile at a local server is not
a matter of changing the base URL — it is a different wire format.

This module owns exactly that: the request/response translation boundary, and
the path a format is served at. It deliberately owns nothing else. Credentials,
rotation, threshold logic and usage capture stay where they are, in gateway.py
and openai_bridge.py — that is the code a live session depends on, and none of
the providers on the roadmap need it abstracted.

Anthropic Messages is deliberately NOT in FORMATS. A Profile speaking it is
proxied byte-for-byte by proxy.py/upstream.py with no translation at all, so
routing it through a translation interface would add a layer that does nothing.
The name exists as a constant so a Profile can record what it speaks, but
asking this module to translate it is a bug, and get() says so rather than
quietly handing back a different format.
