"""Ties Router + Observation + Proxy + secret_store into one handle() call.

This is the Proxy module's orchestration layer (see the implementation
review's module list) — the HTTP-server plumbing lives in daemon.py, the
pure decision/transform logic lives in router.py/observation.py/proxy.py,
and the real socket I/O lives in upstream.py. This file is what a real
request handler calls; it's kept separate from daemon.py's BaseHTTPRequestHandler
subclass so it can be tested with a fake `transport` callable instead of a
real HTTPS connection.

Safety rule, structural rather than by convention: this module NEVER forwards a single byte of the upstream
response body before deciding whether to retry on quota-exhaustion. Status
and headers arrive first (see upstream.send's use of http.client, which
reads the header block before any body read); the retry decision is made
right there, before body_chunks is ever iterated. Once the caller starts
draining body_chunks, that response is committed — Gateway will not retry
underneath it.

        a real captured request: project attribution recorded 12 real
        requests while usage_history recorded 0, because project attribution
        happens before any bytes are streamed while this happens after.
