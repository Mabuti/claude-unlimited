"""Classifies an OpenAI/Codex-backend response's status and headers into the
same Observation union observation.py defines for the Anthropic side.

router.py's rotation logic already works over that union, so a codex-kind
Profile needs a producer of it rather than a new consumer. Like
observation.py, this stays metadata-only: status and headers, never response
bodies.

IMPORTANT: the primary/secondary split is NOT a fixed "primary = 5h,
secondary = 7d" mapping the way Anthropic's unified headers are. Each window
is independently labeled by its own `window-minutes` value (5h, daily,
weekly, monthly or annual), and a window reporting used_percent 0 with no
window-minutes and no reset time is ABSENT rather than a real 0%-used
window. A codex Profile can genuinely have only one quota window, so never
assume two exist.
