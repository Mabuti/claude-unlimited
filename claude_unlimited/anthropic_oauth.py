"""Everything needed to add an OAuth Profile without asking anyone to supply
an account UUID by hand.

Two things this module does:
  1. read_claude_code_credentials() backs the "Import current login" flow:
     it pulls Claude Code's own OAuth token from wherever this OS stores it,
     so nothing has to be copied by hand.
  2. fetch_account_profile() resolves any OAuth access token (imported, or
     pasted from `claude setup-token`) to its account_uuid by asking
     Anthropic directly, so the daemon looks the value up itself.
