"""Pure Rotation decision logic. No I/O, no credentials, no network.

choose() picks which Profile should serve the next request. observe() folds
an Observation (see observation.py) into updated per-profile state. Neither
touches an upstream, a keychain, or a clock beyond what is passed in, which
is what keeps them deterministically testable.

Rotation rules:
  - Sticky: stay on the current Profile until its switch_threshold is crossed
    or it returns quota-exhausted.
  - Never rotate on a bare short rate-limit; that Profile gets a cooldown,
    not a state change away from ELIGIBLE.
  - Tie-break among equally-eligible Profiles: lowest priority number wins;
    among equal priority, whichever has the freshest (or no) usage snapshot.
