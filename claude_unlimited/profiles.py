    """Pair-aware identity lookup for OAuth Profiles.

    `account_uuid` alone is not a unique key: one Anthropic account_uuid can
    surface under more than one organization.uuid — a personal Max plan and
    an organization (Team) seat on the same email address return the SAME
    account.uuid but a DIFFERENT organization.uuid (measured 2026-09-22).
    Deduping on account_uuid alone therefore collapses two separate,
    separately-billed subscriptions into one Profile, silently overwriting
    the first with the second. Identity here is the pair.

    Returns (profile, needs_org_backfill) with exactly three outcomes:
      - Exact match: a Profile with this account_uuid AND this org_uuid
        already exists -> (profile, False). Reuse it as-is.
      - Legacy match: no exact match, but a Profile with this account_uuid
        and org_uuid=None exists -> (profile, True). Reuse it, but signal
        that the caller must backfill org_uuid/organization_type onto it.
        This is what stops a Profile added before this pair became the
        identity from being duplicated the next time its account re-auths —
        without it, every pre-existing Profile would look like a "no match"
        and spawn a duplicate on its very next credential refresh.
      - No match: (None, False). The caller should create a new Profile.

    An exact match always wins over a legacy match when both exist for this
    account_uuid — the pool is scanned for an exact pair match in full before
    a legacy candidate is considered, so which one is stored first in the
    pool never decides the outcome.

    If the `org_uuid` ARGUMENT is None (the caller has no organization
    information for this login — e.g. a bundle or a caller that never
    resolved one), this falls back to matching on account_uuid alone, the
    same single-key behaviour as find_by_account_uuid(), rather than
    refusing to match: a caller that cannot supply an org must never be made
    to create a duplicate just because it doesn't know the org.

    `profiles` lets a caller that already holds an in-progress, unsaved Pool
    snapshot (export_import.apply_import(), which mutates a local `pool`
    across a whole bundle before saving it once) match against that snapshot
    instead of re-reading config.json from disk. Omitted, this reads the
    live pool the same way find_by_account_uuid() does.
