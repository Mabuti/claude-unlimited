"""The one place a Profile "kind"'s identity is declared. See
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for the wider connector design.

Without this registry, a kind's name lives in `_VALID_KINDS` /
`_VALID_AUTH_MODES` in profiles.py plus a scattering of `if p.kind == "..."`
branches, and adding one means grepping for every existing kind string.
This module collects a kind's *identity* into one declared place other
modules can introspect.

Scope is deliberately narrow: identity metadata only. Behavior —
transport dispatch, credential refresh, response classification — is still
owned by each kind's own modules, and the `if p.kind == "X"` branches
elsewhere remain authoritative for it.
